<!--    For this fourth lab, you will be writing CSS code to animate the background color of the
header tag (<h1>) in the HTML code below . Your animation should meet the following
requirements:
1. To start, you should set your <h1> headerâ€™s width to 300px, height to 50px, and
background color to red.
2. The animation should not start until the user hovers their mouse over the header.
3. The animation should be 10 seconds long.
4. Your animation should start with a red background, and then change to blue,
then yellow, then green, then orange, and finally purple. At the end of the 10
seconds, after the background has changed to purple, the animation should
restart.
5. As long as the user keeps their mouse hovered over the header, your animation
should run infinitely, restarting each time it finishes.-->
